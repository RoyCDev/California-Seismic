    <h1> Lecture 2 - Earthquakes</h1>
      <h2> The Official Unofficial Earthquake Primer </h2>
<p> The Seismic Exam doesn’t require advanced knowledge about earthquakes. That being said, this article will give some background on earthquakes that will set the stage for ASCE 7, but it won’t cover anything extensively. The relevance here is to provide enough context about earthquakes so that seismic engineering can be explained. A simple glance through should be more than enough for the actual exam questions.</p>

<h3> Causes of Earthquakes </h3>
<p> There are several sources of earthquakes. These include: </p>
<ul>
<li> Tectonic Plate Movement </li>
<li> Explosions (Chemical/Nuclear) </li>
<li> Volcanic Eruptions </li>
<li> Mine Bursts </li>
</ul>
<p> The most relevant source in California would be those earthquakes occurring from tectonic plate movement. The lithospheric plates (the outermost part of the earth) are in motion. So why do they move? Because they are resting on top of a plastic mantle layer that is also in motion. Convection currents form in the mantle because the center of the earth is hotter than the outter layer, so heat difference creates a current that drives the mantle, and subsequently moves the lithospheric plates. You can imagine these giant masses of land pushing around each other in various ways, there must be some impacts from this. One is that plates get stuck against each other, but really want to move! This creates a build up of strain energy, that once released creates a large wave of energy known as an earthquake. </p>

<h3> Whose Fault Is It? </h3>
<p> Faults are a physical record of earth movements. They can be seen at the earth’s surface when different layers/levels of land appear offset. It’s worth noting that these movements along the earth can happen without surface rupture, so there are still many faults below the earth’s surface that may not be known. The displacement event of faults can be slow and timid, or fast and violent. Faults are also classified by their geometry. </p>
<ul>
<li> Strike-Slip Fault </li>
<li> Dip-Slip Fault </li>
<li> Reverse Fault </li>
</ul>
<p>Other terminology for describing faults includes strike and dip. The dip of a fault is the angle the fault surface makes with the horizontal. Strike is the angle between the fault line and North </p>

<h3> Ride the Wave</h3>
<p> During an earthquake, seismic waves radiate outwards from the focus point. The focus point is considered the origin point of the waves, and is usually some depth below the earth’s surface. Shallow-focus earthquakes are defined as having a focus depth less than 70 km, which are the predominant type of earthquakes in California. The closer the focus is to the surface, the more violent and destructive the earthquake can be. The other common terminology is epicenter, which is the point on the ground surface directly above the focus.</p>

<p> There are multiple waves that occur from a seismic event. They are classified as either Body Waves or Surface Waves. Body waves can move through the interior of the earth, Surface Waves only occur on the surface of the earth. </p>

<p>P-waves (compression waves) are the fastest, and move similar to sound waves by spreading outwards. They can travel through both liquids and solids, and they alternatively push and pull the surrounding material.P-waves are typically felt first during an earthquake</p>

<p> S-waves (shear waves) are slower, and as they propogate they shear the rock sideways at right angles to the direction of travel. S-waves cannot move through liquids. The motion of S-waves at the ground surface produces both a horizontal and vertical motion. This is important to realize that there is a vertical motion to earthquakes, not just side to side. S-waves are the most effective in damaging structures, and usually come second after the P-waves.Both P-waves and S-waves can occur below and at the earth’s surface</p>

<p> The last category of waves are known as surface waves, these include Love-waves and Rayleigh-waves. Love-waves are similar to S-waves, however they do not produce vertical displacements. Rayleigh-waves move similar to a rolling ocean wave, moving both vertically and horizontally in a vertical plane at the direction of travel. </p>

<h3> Measuring Earthquakes </h3>
<p> Earthquake measurements were first done based off human perception. This was useful at the time, but more scientific methods have become the norm as technology and needs have changed. The first intensity scale used to qualitatively describe earthquakes was created by de Rossi of Italy and Forel of Switzerland. It was used in reports that described the intensity of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. It was based on a scale from one to ten at increasing levels of shaking and damage to structures. The levels were not very scientific, and a need for something that more accurately described the earthquake was fulfilled in 1935 by Charles Richter. Richter created a method for measuring an earthquake’s intensity by defining a magnitude. The magnitude was defined by the log to base ten of the maximum wave amplitude  in microns recorded by a specific Wood-Anderson seismograph which had to be located 100 km from the earthquake epicenter. This is a commonly referred to intensity scale for earthquakes, however it has a drawback in that it is based off a specific seismograph instrument that has its own physical period. The Wood-Anderson seismograph amplifies seismic waves within a period range of 0.1 to 2 seconds, so there is some bias in how an earthquake was measured. Today, a more precise approach for earthquake magnitudes is accepted, called Moment Magnitude. The moment magnitude scale defines intensity based off the energy released by the earthquake put into a logarithmic scale. This scale is so valuable because it is the only magnitude scale that doesn’t suffer from saturation problems, meaning it can accurately scale any size earthquake.</p>

<h3>Earthquake Response Spectra </h3>
<p>We’ve established some basic geological principles and history about earthquakes, but what information is used on a daily basis for practicing engineers? The answer is Response Spectra. Important characterizations of ground motions for practicing engineers would include peak ground acceleration, peak ground velocity, peak ground displacement. Those are all included on a typical response spectra plot. Other valuable ground motion information would be the duration of motion, and frequency content. Let’s look at a typical response spectra, review the relevant parts, and convince ourselves that this diagram could be constructed for any location in California. <b>This diagram will almost certainly show up on the Seismic Principles Exam!</b></p>
