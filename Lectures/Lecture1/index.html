        <h1>Lecture 1: Intro to the Seismic Exam</h1>

<h2> What is the Seismic Principles Exam?</h2>

        <p> The California Seismic Principles Exam is one of two state-specific exams required by California that must be passed before an engineer-in-training (EIT) may be issued an official PE license. This license will grant the title of <q>Professional Engineer,</q> and will allow a person to legally use a variety of <q>Engineer</q> titles that are protected in California. A PE license also allows a person to stamp drawings and calculations that are typically required by building jurisdictions for the issuance of a construction permit. But if you&#8217re reading this, you probably know all that. For most EIT&#8217s, the seismic exam is just the next hoop to jump through before they get their license. <mark>55 questions, 150 minutes, and sub 50% pass rate.</mark> </p>

<h2> Never Tell Me the Odds </h2>

<p> Often of interest, the pass rate is something that we as test takers fixate on. Maybe when deciding how much effort to put in, or after the exam when tallying up the questions we knew were correct. Luckily the Board has some historical information available.</p>
<img src="testTakerGraph.png"> </img>


<p>Around three to four thousand people are taking the Seismic Exam each year. The actual amount of people getting a license each year will obviously be less though, because there are repeat test takers.</p>
<img src="graphPassing.png"> </img>

<p>The typical pass rate appears to be around 45-50% in the past few years, with a slight upwards trend. </p>

<p>The info we all want, how many questions do I need to get right to pass? It turns out the Board only has public historical data from 2009 and backwards for the question cutrate. Since it&#8217s over a decade old, this information is more of an interesting fact rather than a solid predictor. So instead of predicting, <mark>we might speculate that a passing score is 50% of questions correct.</mark></p>

<p>Just remember that this isn&#8217t true chance, we can improve our probability of passing by studying more, increasing our familiarity with common questions, and getting a good night’s rest.</p>

    <h2> What am I Actually Being Tested On? </h2>
<p> My friend in college once eloquently rejected a question about why he wasn’t going to work as a structural engineer, after all he seemed to have a knack for structural classes. His response was that there was no way he&#8217d be a <q>code monkey</q>. A code monkey?? This is offensive to monkeys. Structural engineering is not just about reading through codes and following the rules created by code committees. There&#8217s real challenges requiring engineering judgement, time management, and liability. But I wouldn&#8217t use the Seismic Exam to defend this comment... The Seismic Exam will test your ability to follow the currently legal code book that defines design parameters for most building structures. It’s like setting the dinner table at Thanksgiving, yes it&#8217s important for the meal but it&#8217s not the end game. So if you&#8217re feeling anxious about what you need to learn, remember that it is relatively confined exam. Questions don&#8217t require extensive knowledge beyond <mark>ASCE 7, basic statics, and maybe some rigid diaphragm analysis.</mark></p>


<h2> What Code Books Do I Need? </h2>

<p> A list of recommended resources is available at <a href=”https://www.bpelsg.ca.gov/applicants/cerefs.shtml”>the engineering board&#8217s website. </a>  There&#8217s 6 books/codes listed. The most important code reference is ASCE 7-16 (The 7 stands for which ASCE code book, the 16 stands for the year it came out. Future references to this book will use the shorthand of ASCE 7). The most common types of questions on the seismic exam will require direct use of ASCE 7 to answer them. From one test-taker&#8217s perspective, you can get by with that single code book (and any accumulated notes). However to nab some additional potential questions, it won&#8217t hurt to have a copy of the SDPWS and TMS. There are also some worthwhile sections in the CBC to have at least printed and put into a binder. This topic is best explained in its own section though, so the materials you bring to the exam are listed more clearly under the <q>Exam Info</q> tab.</p>

<p>A sample breakdown of question types is presented below. Note that there is a <a href="https://www.bpelsg.ca.gov/applicants/plan_civseism.pdf">list by the Board</a> for the exact question types, but it&#8217s kind of hard to relate that in a quick, meaningful way. Below is an attempt to visualize exactly what knowledge is required to answer the questions, just note the percentages are a rough approximation by feeling, not real data.</p>

<h2>How Much Should I Study?</h2>
<p> Your background and ability to solve sample questions is the best indicator of additional study time required to pass the exam. This will vary based on a large variety of factors, from classes in college to current professional experience. Some people on popular engineer forums report studying for literally hundreds of hours, while others just start a couple weeks before the exam. Depending on your free time outside of work, you’ll have to gauge the time required. Starting a couple months before the exam date certainly seems reasonable for most people however.</p>

<p>The below pie chart displays some info on the breakdown of national exam types. The second half of the PE national exam is in a chosen discipline, and the Seismic Exam is most aligned with structural engineering. So we could argue that around 20% of people taking the Seismic Exam are inherently familiar with the exam material. This means there&#8217s likely a group of 80% test takers that will need to do more serious studying for the exam, while 20% can focus more on review.</p>

<h2> A Warning </h2>
<p>At this point, you know how study. This isn’t your first exam. One last thought is about practice exams, specifically when to utilize them. The average test taker will undoubtedly have found some practice exams (legally or not) for their studies. If at all possible, consider leaving a full practice exam towards the end of your studies. A week before the exam, try taking the test in a timed setting with minimal distraction. Put yourself into the mode of not using any resources outside of the ones you’re bringing to the exam. The results from a strict self-imposed exam can give great insight to your current preparation level, but <b>it doesn’t work if you’ve already done that exam!</b> Doing a full timed practice exam that you&#8217ve been using to study off of is a great way to solidify some false confidence. So if you can, <mark>consider leaving a practice exam untouched until you want to verify your preparation level.</mark></p>
